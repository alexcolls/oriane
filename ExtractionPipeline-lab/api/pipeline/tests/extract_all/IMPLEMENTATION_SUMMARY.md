# Main.py Batching Logic Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the main.py batching logic according to the specifications provided in Step 8.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Load State & List Codes from S3
- ✅ Implemented `list_instagram_codes()` function in `s3_utils.py`
- ✅ Loads state from `processed.json` using `StateManager`
- ✅ Gets all Instagram codes from S3 bucket `oriane-contents` with prefix `instagram/`
- ✅ Filters out already processed codes

### 2. Batch Processing Logic
- ✅ For each unprocessed code, checks if extracted in Qdrant using `is_video_extracted()`
- ✅ Adds non-extracted codes to `current_batch`
- ✅ When `len(current_batch) >= BATCH_LIMIT`, calls `dispatch_batch()`
- ✅ Handles remaining codes in final batch after enumeration

### 3. Dispatch Batch Implementation
- ✅ Saves request JSON to `requests/batch-<n>.json`
- ✅ Calls `api_client.submit_batch()` to get job_id
- ✅ Appends job_id to `active_jobs` dictionary for tracking

### 4. Job Monitoring
- ✅ Implemented `job_monitor.run_all(active_jobs)` method
- ✅ Monitors all active jobs concurrently until completion
- ✅ Returns comprehensive results with success/failure statistics

### 5. State Management
- ✅ Updates `processed.json` with successfully completed video codes
- ✅ Marks processed codes with job_id and result data
- ✅ Handles failed jobs appropriately

### 6. Graceful Shutdown
- ✅ Implements SIGINT/SIGTERM signal handlers
- ✅ Cancels active job monitors on shutdown
- ✅ Persists final state before exit
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging

## New Components Added

### JobMonitor.run_all()
- Monitors multiple jobs concurrently
- Returns detailed results with success/failure statistics
- Handles exceptions gracefully

### QdrantUtils.is_video_extracted()
- Checks if video code already exists in Qdrant collection
- Uses HTTP API with proper filtering
- Returns boolean indicating extraction status

### Configuration Updates
- Added `batch_limit` property to Config class
- Supports configuration via environment variables
- Default batch limit of 100 items

```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
python3 main.py
```

### With Options
```bash
python3 main.py --limit 50 --log-level DEBUG --resume
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
BATCH_LIMIT=50
STATUS_INTERVAL=30
HTTP_TIMEOUT=30
QDRANT_URL=http://localhost:6333
PIPELINE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## Error Handling
- ✅ Graceful handling of API failures
- ✅ Retry logic for Qdrant connection issues
- ✅ Comprehensive logging at all levels
- ✅ State persistence on errors
- ✅ Signal handling for clean shutdown

## Testing
- ✅ Created `test_main.py` for component verification
- ✅ All components can be initialized successfully
- ✅ Configuration loading works correctly
- ✅ State management functions properly

## Compliance with Requirements
All specified requirements from Step 8 have been implemented:

1. ✅ Load state & list codes from S3
2. ✅ For each code not in processed: check if extracted in Qdrant → add to current_batch
3. ✅ When len(current_batch)==BATCH_LIMIT: dispatch_batch()
4. ✅ dispatch_batch() saves request JSON and calls api_client.submit_batch
5. ✅ After all videos enumerated, dispatch any remainder
6. ✅ Await job_monitor.run_all(active_jobs)
7. ✅ Update processed.json with successfully completed video codes
8. ✅ Graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM: cancel monitors, persist state

The implementation is ready for production use and follows best practices for async programming, error handling, and state management.
