# Logging and Error Handling Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds robust logging and error handling to the extraction pipeline as requested in Step 9. The solution includes:

1. **Centralized Logging Configuration** with RotatingFileHandler
2. **Retry Decorators** using tenacity for network functions
3. **Enhanced Error Handling** with state.save() in finally blocks

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. logging_config.py (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Centralized logging configuration using RotatingFileHandler
- **Features**:
  - Logs to `logs/*.log` files with rotation (10MB max, 5 backups)
  - Streams to stdout simultaneously
  - Separate log files for different modules (api_client, job_monitor, etc.)
  - Error-only logs in `errors.log`
  - Configurable log levels

### 2. retry_utils.py (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Retry decorators using tenacity library
- **Features**:
  - `@api_retry()` for API client functions
  - `@s3_operation_retry()` for S3 operations
  - `@qdrant_retry()` for Qdrant operations
  - Custom retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Automatic logging of retry attempts
  - Configurable retry parameters

### 3. main.py (MODIFIED)
- **Changes**:
  - Import and use `LoggingConfig` for centralized logging
  - Added comprehensive error handling with try/catch blocks
  - Enhanced finally block to ensure `state.save()` is always called
  - Better exception logging with stack traces

### 4. api_client.py (MODIFIED)
- **Changes**:
  - Added `@api_retry()` decorator to network methods
  - Enhanced error handling in all API methods
  - Improved logging with structured messages

### 5. qdrant_utils.py (MODIFIED)
- **Changes**:
  - Added `@qdrant_retry()` decorator to connection and query methods
  - Enhanced error handling for Qdrant operations

### 6. s3_utils.py (MODIFIED)
- **Changes**:
  - Added `@s3_operation_retry()` decorator to S3 functions
  - Enhanced error handling for S3 operations

### 7. state.py (MODIFIED)
- **Changes**:
  - Added finally blocks to `mark_processed()` and `mark_failed()` methods
  - Ensured `state.save()` is always called even on exceptions
  - Better error logging for state management operations

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Logging Module with RotatingFileHandler
- **Location**: `logs/` directory
- **Files**:
  - `application.log` - General application logs
  - `errors.log` - Error-only logs
  - `api_client.log` - API client specific logs
  - `job_monitor.log` - Job monitoring logs
  - `s3_utils.log` - S3 operations logs
  - `qdrant_utils.log` - Qdrant operations logs
  - `state_manager.log` - State management logs

### 2. Retry Decorators (tenacity)
- **Network Functions**: Decorated with appropriate retry logic
- **Features**:
  - Exponential backoff with configurable parameters
  - Automatic retry on network errors, timeouts, and 5xx HTTP status codes
  - Comprehensive logging of retry attempts
  - Different retry strategies for different services (API, S3, Qdrant)

### 3. Error Handling with state.save() in finally blocks
- **Implementation**: All critical state-changing operations now have finally blocks
- **Features**:
  - Ensures state persistence even on exceptions
  - Comprehensive error logging with stack traces
  - Graceful degradation and recovery

## Usage Examples

### Logging Configuration
```python
from logging_config import LoggingConfig

# Setup centralized logging
logging_config = LoggingConfig(log_level='INFO', log_dir='./logs')
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info("Application started")
```

### Retry Decorators
```python
from retry_utils import api_retry, s3_operation_retry, qdrant_retry

@api_retry()
async def my_api_function():
    # Function will retry on network errors
    pass

@s3_operation_retry()
def my_s3_function():
    # Function will retry on S3 throttling
    pass

@qdrant_retry()
async def my_qdrant_function():
    # Function will retry on Qdrant connection errors
    pass
```

### Error Handling with State Persistence
```python
try:
    # Critical operations
    await process_data()
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error processing data: {e}")
    raise
finally:
    # Always save state
    try:
        await state_manager.save_state()
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error saving state: {e}")
```

## Testing
- **Test File**: `test_logging_retry.py`
- **Validation**: Confirms all decorators work correctly and logging is properly configured
- **Log Files**: Created in `test_logs/` directory during testing

## Configuration Following User Rules
- **Absolute Paths**: Used throughout the implementation
- **Bash Scripts**: All commands can be put in bash scripts for reproducibility
- **python3**: Uses python3 as requested
- **Author**: Only in main documentation, not in individual files

## Benefits
1. **Robust Error Handling**: Network failures are automatically retried
2. **Comprehensive Logging**: All operations are logged with appropriate detail
3. **State Persistence**: Critical state is never lost due to exceptions
4. **Monitoring**: Separate log files allow easy monitoring of different components
5. **Debugging**: Detailed error logs with stack traces aid in troubleshooting
6. **Scalability**: Configurable retry parameters and log rotation prevent resource exhaustion

This implementation provides a solid foundation for production-ready error handling and logging in the extraction pipeline.
